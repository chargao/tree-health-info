            <p>We are an international group, primarily based in California, Texas, and Germany. What unites us is our
                shared love for nature, our ecosystems, and a deep curiosity about the processes that occur within them.
            </p>
            <p>Our mission is to help people better understand and observe the natural processes in their immediate
                surroundings by providing them with educational resources and opportunities, such as informational
                materials and workshops.
            </p>
            <p>At the same time, we aim to act as a connector, bringing together groups that have already taken action
                and are actively contributing to environmental initiatives.</p>
