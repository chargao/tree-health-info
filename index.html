    <h2>How to Check a Tree's Health</h2>
    <section class="left">
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>Thinning Leaves</h3>
          <p>Stand beneath the tree—can you see the sky through the branches? A healthy tree crown should be lush and
            full, providing shade and absorbing sunlight. If the canopy looks sparse, it could indicate stress from
            pests
            (such as the oak processionary moth) or diseases like ash dieback, which disrupts water flow and causes leaf
            loss.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Discolored Leaves</h3>
            <p>The color of a tree's leaves can tell you a lot. Healthy green leaves mean efficient photosynthesis, but
              yellow, brown, or prematurely falling leaves are warning signs. Uneven color or size might indicate nutrient
              deficiency or poor root function, often due to waterlogging, soil compaction, or drought.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Dieback and Deadwood</h3>
            <p>Check the branch tips—are there many small dead twigs or dying branches? This could mean the tree is
              stressed. Healthy trees grow new branches each year, so if parts of the crown are dying, it’s a strong
              indicator that something’s wrong.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Dead or Flaking Bark</h3>
            <p>The bark is a tree’s protective layer. If you notice sticky, sap-like fluid leaking from the trunk, it
              could
              mean trouble within the tree’s cambium layer. This might be caused by fungal or bacterial infections or even
              pest damage from insects like the great spruce bark beetle.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>The Trunk</h3>
            <p>The trunk is the backbone of the tree, supporting the crown and transporting nutrients. Look for cracks,
              bulges, or wounds in the bark, as these can weaken the tree structurally and allow pathogens to enter.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Roots</h3>
            <p>The roots anchor the tree and provide it with water and nutrients. Exposed or damaged roots, or any recent
              digging around them, can disrupt this system and weaken the tree. Check for visible root damage, especially
              after any nearby soil disturbance.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Fungi</h3>
            <p>Certain fungi, like honey fungus, can be lethal to trees by killing their roots. Look for signs such as
              white
              fungal mats, black “bootlace” rhizomorphs under the bark, or honey-colored mushrooms around the base in late
              summer. Bracket fungi, like Ganoderma, can also indicate internal decay.</p>
          </li>
      </ol>

      Be mindful and keep an eye on the trees around you. Many issues can be effectively treated if they’re caught
      early.
      Watering during particularly hot periods can also be especially beneficial for young trees. There are various
      organizations and associations dedicated to caring for trees in your area. Become a tree protector, too!
